## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, include = FALSE}
#importing data from github and reading the csv file
guns_death<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
gun_death<- read_csv(guns_death)
#this next line is creating a subset called 'youth' of the guns_death data
youth <-subset(gun_death,age<=65)
summary(youth)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
#Gun deaths by age
```{r youth-dist, echo=FALSE}
 
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age))+
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)


```
#Gun deaths by race
```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}

youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race)%>%fct_rev()))+
  geom_bar()+coord_flip()+labs(x="Victim race")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
